                Xiaomi has been a leader in smart phone manufacturing for several years. Mainly because of the very good
                combination of relatively low price and high performance and quality of processing. Smarphone Mi6 from
                the Mi model line is not the latest and even the most powerful, but still one of the powerful. The
                portal "gsmarena.com" scores this smartphone with a rating of 4.6 / 5 which in itself is excellent, but

                credible camera, solid battery life, quality stereo sound"

                The Xiaomi Mi6 is powered by a powerful but somewhat old chipset from the well-known Qualcomm -
                Snapdragon 835 and the Adreno 540 graphics accelerator. The IPS display does not have the highest
                resolution (only 1080p - full HD) but boasts a very true color representation and a high dynamic range.
